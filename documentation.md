# The purpose of your application I want a household expense tracking tool that allows users to record, monitor and analyse their household expenses. This tool should support the categorisation of expenses for better organisation and understanding of spending habits.


# Scope of your application
I will build a household expense tracking tool using Contember. This tool will allow users to record, monitor, and analyze their household expenses. Users will be able to categorize their expenses for better organization and understanding of their spending habits. The generated application will be a working draft that can be deployed to Contember cloud for testing and further development. Users will also have the option to download the code and start working on it immediately.
## What can Contember not do for my project?
Contember cannot:

1. Automatically create a custom user interface tailored to your specific needs. While Contember Interface provides high-level React components for building management interfaces, you may still need to customize the UI to match your project requirements.
2. Handle complex business logic or custom functionality that goes beyond the built-in features. For such cases, you would need to extend the application with custom code.
3. Provide real-time updates or WebSocket support out-of-the-box. If your project requires real-time updates, you would need to implement this functionality yourself.
4. Offer built-in support for third-party integrations or APIs. You would need to develop custom solutions to integrate external services with your Contember application.
5. Automatically optimize performance for large-scale applications. While Contember is designed to be scalable, you may need to fine-tune performance settings and optimize your data model for specific use cases.

Keep in mind that Contember is a powerful and flexible platform, but it may require additional development effort to implement certain features or functionality that are not part of its core offering.
